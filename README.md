Chrome extension to remember your username at wellsfargo.com
===

### Also automatically focuses password input field for super quick login.

I don't use Chrome's Autofill for usernames, passwords, forms, etc. I do use the *Remember me* checkboxes on websites for setting a cookie to remember my username across visits. Wells Fargo doesn't have that for its site, so this fixes that with `localStorage`.

## Usage

Load the [extension](/extension/) directory as [an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) in Chrome, or pack the extension and install it if you don't want to keep the directory of files on your computer. Or just install it at [the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cgadmadfnbdaplnanejoebmbfpgpliee).

Login at [the Wells Fargo homepage](https://www.wellsfargo.com/) and enjoy not having to type your username at every visit.
