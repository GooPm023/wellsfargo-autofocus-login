Chrome extension to autofocus the login fields (username/password) at wellsfargo.com
===

## Formerly "Wells Fargo - Remember Username"

### Automatically focuses password input field for super quick login.

The Wells Fargo homepage did not have a "Remember username" checkbox for a very long time, so this extension sought to remedy that problem. Now it does. (Way to go, web team!) But it still doesn't autofocus the username/password input fields on page load, so this takes care of that for you.

## Usage

Load the [extension](/extension/) directory as [an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) in Chrome, or pack the extension and install it locally. Or just install it directly at [the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cgadmadfnbdaplnanejoebmbfpgpliee).

Then login at [the Wells Fargo homepage](https://www.wellsfargo.com/) and enjoy not having to take your hands off of the keyboard in order to login at every visit.
